### Loyalty Program
Among the 32,501 loyalty members, the customer lifetime value (CLV), which evaluates how valuable a customer is over time , is significantly lower than non-members, averaging only $242.75, compared to $313.37 for non-members. This indicates that loyalty members do not contribute as much long-term value as expected.

Additionally, loyalty members have fewer total orders (32,789) and average order value ($240.62) compared to non-members (48,071; $274.66). Members also exhibit a refund rate of 6.39%, which is higher than non-members (4.16%).  For the refunded items, loyalty members have a average refund price of $297.38, a total of 2,095 refunds and with the highest refund price of $1,444.94, while the corresponding numbers for non-members are $549.79 average refund price, 2,000 refunds, and the highest refund price of $3,146.88. The concerns for refunds and buying high-price items don't seem to be the reason that incentivize customers to join loyalty program. 

The most concerning trend is that 99.53% of loyalty members make only a single purchase while the repeat purchase rate for non-members is 23x higher (10.67%), comparing to 0.47% for members. The purchase frequency calculated by averaging the total orders is higher for non-members (1.14), comparing to 1.01 for members. This suggests that many customers may be joining the loyalty program solely to take advantage of some one-time offer like discounts, without remaining engaged with the company.

Based on the analysis, TechNova’s loyalty program is failing to drive long-term customer engagement or increase revenue. Instead of encouraging repeat purchases, it appears to attract deal-seekers who exploit one-time benefits without fostering sustained customer loyalty.

### Marketing Channel
Among the 92,527 customers, only 4,902 are repeating customers while the average order value by returning customers ($422.34) is 1.7x higher than new customers ($250.16). 

The direct marketing channel is the most effective, generating the highest total sales ($17.48M) and the most orders (62,854) with a strong average order value (AOV) of $278.06. The null (unattributed) category follows with significant sales ($7.26M) and a comparable AOV ($256.94), suggesting a need to track its origin. Affiliate marketing has the highest AOV ($317.85), indicating high-value transactions despite lower order volume (2,102). Email marketing drives a decent number of orders (13,832) but has a relatively low AOV ($177.79), while social media contributes fewer orders (1,012) but maintains a moderate AOV ($234.64). Unknown sources have minimal impact. Improving attribution tracking and optimizing lower-performing channels could enhance overall effectiveness.

Social media performs well with a 68.92% conversion rate, suggesting strong engagement, though it takes the longest for users to make their first purchase (49.14 days). Affiliate marketing also has a high conversion rate (53.74%) but a slightly shorter time to first purchase (47.79 days). The null category has moderate performance (45.16% conversion rate) but slow conversion (52.32 days). Email marketing drives a large number of signups (13,356) but has a much lower 10.69% conversion rate, indicating potential drop-offs. Direct traffic, despite the highest number of signups (57,722), has the lowest conversion rate (2.53%), suggesting that while many users visit directly, few convert, or they take a different path to conversion.
