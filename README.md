# TechNova Trend and Strategy Analysis
Founded in 2018, TechNova is a global e-commerce company specializing in electronics and tech products. Initially focused on online sales, Technova has expanded its reach through both its website and mobile app, catering to a diverse international customer base.

To acquire and retain customers, Technova leverages a mix of marketing channels, including email campaigns, social media, SEO, and affiliate partnerships. The company has built a strong reputation for offering premium and high-demand tech products, particularly from Apple, Samsung, and ThinkPad, among others.

## Executive Summary
TechNova’s analysis shows that although repeat customers—just 5% of 92,527—drive significantly higher order values, current strategies, including the loyalty program and tracking of unattributed sales, are not effectively fostering long-term engagement. The major action step is to increase customer retention efforts by changing to a new loyalty program to encourage repeat purchases and implementing robust attribution tracking, ensuring sustainable revenue growth across all channels.

## Deep Dive Insights
### Overview
Between 2019 and 2022, the dataset records 108K orders and $28M in sales. TechNova serves customers from 193 countries and offers a portfolio of 8 electronic product categories, including laptops, monitors, and headphones. 

### Trend Analysis
In March 2020, a pronounced spike suggests a pandemic-driven surge in demand—particularly for items like monitors, headphones, and laptops—while a significant dip in October 2022 may reflect market shifts or economic pressures.

Seasonal trends are evident, with November and December consistently recording the highest growth (likely due to holiday shopping) followed by a downturn in the surrounding months.

Comparing total sales, order count, and average order value (AOV) reveals that sales and order counts generally correlate. However, AOV sometimes diverges, indicating periods when customers favor higher-value purchases.

Additionally, the data shows that 2019 and 2020 experienced more prominent growth spikes, whereas 2021 and 2022 saw more frequent declines. This shift could be attributed to factors such as post-pandemic market saturation, inflation, or the inherently less frequent nature of electronics purchases compared to essentials.

### Geographic Distribution
TechNova's total sales are primarily concentrated in English-speaking countries, with the U.S. leading, followed by Great Britain and Canada. Although the overall sales distribution remained consistent from 2019 to 2022, the pandemic year of 2020 saw an increase in total sales across the top 10 countries (especially US had total sales over $3M USD), reflecting a global surge in demand for electronic devices.

![Sheet 3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/845291a5-d4ff-4559-bd1d-051c280ab859)

Regionally, North America records the highest total orders, followed by EMEA, APAC, and LATAM, while EMEA boasts the highest average order value (AOV), outpacing APAC, North America, and LATAM. Given that most customers currently come from North America, TechNova should consider expanding further into the EMEA market to capture high-value clientele.

### Star Products 
Among all the products, Apple Airpods are the most popular from 2019 to 2022 contributed to an average 45% of the total order counts across the years, following by monitors and cables, which occupied about an average of 20% of the total order counts each. 

![%Order Counts Product](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/afcc5853-46cc-4a5a-a5b2-1bd629ff2fae)

The huge number of total orders of Apple Airpods contributed about 30% of the total sales throughout the years, which is ranked at the 2nd place in terms of the % of the total sales. The gaming monitors contributed the most (about 40%) in terms of the total sales across the years. Both MacBooks (~20%) and ThinkPad laptops (~10%) ranked as 3rd and 4th in terms of the % of the total sales while both items only contributed less than 5% in terms of the total order counts. It's also worth noting that in 2020, when the pandemic began, there was an increase for MacBooks. 

![% total sales producti](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3987d719-a923-469d-a811-8983ed2f81cb)

Apple Airpods and gaming monitors are the first and second contributors to the sales of TechNova. 


### Refund Rate 
The area graph on the % of the number of refunds across the months shows a positive relationship between the number of orders and the number of refunds. For the most popular product, Apple Airpods, while taking an average 45% of the total monthly orders, Airpods occupied about 50% of the refunds every month. However, starting from Aug 2021 onwards, there was no refund, which is likely caused by missing data. 

![% Refund Count per Product](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/861568f5-252e-4844-937d-e5acbcb77e6d)

In general, the refund rates for MacBooks and ThinkPad Laptops are higher (overall ~20%) comparing to the other products throughout 2019 to 2021 (there is no data from Aug 2021 onwards). On the other hand, iPhones have the highest fluctuation and several notable spikes in refund rates. For instance, in Feb and May 2019, iPhones have 33% refund rate. In Aug 2020 and Mar 2021, the refund rates for iPhones are over 40%. 

Additionally, it’s worth noting that Bose Headphones recorded zero refunds across all four years. This exceptional performance invites further investigation into the factors driving such positive results.

### Loyalty Program

#### Total Order Count & Total Sales:
Non-loyalty typically has a higher total order count overall, but an important crossover happens in March 2021, where loyalty’s total sales catch up and then slightly surpass non-loyalty.
This suggests that although non-loyalty customers place more orders on average, the loyalty segment’s purchase volume and/or frequency grew sufficiently to drive higher overall sales from March 2021 through mid/late 2022. Likely factors include targeted promotions, improved loyalty benefits, or a successful acquisition campaign that converted existing shoppers into loyal program members.

#### Average Order Value (AOV):
For most of the observed period (2019–2022), non-loyalty customers exhibit a higher AOV than loyalty customers. This could mean that while non-loyalty shoppers spend more per transaction, they might be less frequent purchasers. An exception emerges around early 2021 onward, where loyalty AOV occasionally narrows the gap or briefly surpasses non-loyalty AOV. This fluctuation hints that either loyalty customers were encouraged to buy higher-priced items or that promotional strategies specifically boosted their spending during those months.

#### Loyalty Join Rate by Product:
From 2019 to mid-2021, the loyalty join rate for key products (e.g., gaming monitors, Apple devices, and Samsung accessories) showed a clear upward trend. This rise indicates successful recruitment efforts or appealing loyalty perks during that timeframe.

Post-mid-2021, a downward trend in join rates emerges, suggesting possible market saturation, waning promotional impact, or program fatigue. This decline might call for revamping the loyalty program or introducing fresh incentives to maintain and grow membership.

#### Overall Program Implications:
The data points to growing importance of loyalty customers—they may spend less per order on average but still generate significant total revenue due to increased frequency or volume.
The crossover in total sales around March 2021 is particularly telling: loyalty became a critical revenue driver. Maintaining that momentum may require addressing the recent drop in join rates, whether through new tiers, personalized offers, or enhanced rewards.

In summary, loyalty’s lower AOV is offset by higher order volume, leading to a notable sales advantage from March 2021 onward. However, to sustain this performance, investigating membership growth and engagement will be essential—especially in light of the join-rate decline after mid-2021.

### Marketing Channel
Among 92,527 customers, only 4,902 are repeat buyers, yet returning customers boast an average order value (AOV) of $422—approximately 1.7 times higher than the $250 recorded for new customers.

**Marketing Channel Performance:**

- **Direct Marketing:**  
  Generates the highest total sales of $17.48M and 62,854 orders, with a strong AOV of $278.

- **Unattributed (Null) Category:**  
  Accounts for significant sales of $7.26M and an AOV of $256, highlighting a need for better tracking of its origins.

- **Affiliate Marketing:**  
  Despite a lower order volume of 2,102, it achieves the highest AOV at $317, indicating high-value transactions.

- **Email Marketing:**  
  Drives a healthy number of orders (13,832) but with a relatively low AOV of $177.

- **Social Media:**  
  Contributes fewer orders (1,012) while maintaining a moderate AOV of $234.

Unknown sources have minimal impact. Improving attribution tracking and optimizing lower-performing channels could enhance overall effectiveness.

**Conversion Rate Insights:**

- Conversion rates across channels have remained relatively stable over the years (over 99%).
- The affiliate program stands out with a 100% conversion rate, outperforming social media, direct marketing, and email.
- In 2020, all channels experienced a dip in performance—likely due to pandemic-related disruptions in marketing activities.

## Recommendations

### Refund 
- Investigate the refund rate in 2022 to make sure that the positive result is not due to missing data.
- Understand what are the factors that make Bose Headphones perform well and apply the findings to all the other products. 

### Loyalty Program
Instead of rewarding new members with discounts, introduce tier-based loyalty program to enhance customer loyalty. 
- **Basic Members**: Get free shipping after 2 purchases.
- **Gold Members**: Earn cashback or discounts on their 3rd+ purchase.
- **Platinum Members**: Get exclusive early access to new products.

### Boost Customer Retention
With only 5% of customers returning, it's vital to implement strategies that encourage repeat purchases. Consider targeted retention campaigns, loyalty program enhancements, or personalized post-purchase follow-ups to convert new customers into long-term buyers, thereby leveraging the significantly higher average order value seen with returning customers.

### Marketing Channel
1. Enhance Attribution Tracking
- The unattributed (null) sales category accounts for substantial revenue. Investing in improved tracking and analytics can help identify the origin of these sales, enabling more informed marketing investments and resource allocation.

2. Leverage High-Performing Channels:
- **Direct Marketing:** Maintain and optimize this channel as it generates the highest total sales and order volume.
- **Affiliate Marketing:** Although order volume is lower, its high AOV indicates quality transactions. Scaling this channel could further boost revenue without sacrificing order value.

3. Revise Underperforming Channels:
- **Email Marketing:** Despite driving a decent number of orders, its low AOV suggests a need for revisiting messaging, segmentation, or promotional strategies to increase the value per transaction.  
- **Social Media:** While contributing fewer orders, efforts could be made to improve engagement and conversion quality.
