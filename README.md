### Loyalty Program
Among the 32,501 loyalty members, the customer lifetime value (CLV), which evaluates how valuable a customer is over time , is significantly lower than non-members, averaging only $242.75, compared to $313.37 for non-members. This indicates that loyalty members do not contribute as much long-term value as expected.

Additionally, loyalty members have fewer total orders (32,789) and average order value ($240.62) compared to non-members (48,071; $274.66). Members also exhibit a refund rate of 6.39%, which is higher than non-members (4.16%).  For the refunded items, loyalty members have a average refund price of $297.38, a total of 2,095 refunds and with the highest refund price of $1,444.94, while the corresponding numbers for non-members are $549.79 average refund price, 2,000 refunds, and the highest refund price of $3,146.88. The concerns for refunds and buying high-price items don't seem to be the reason that incentivize customers to join loyalty program. 

The most concerning trend is that 99.53% of loyalty members make only a single purchase while the repeat purchase rate for non-members is 23x higher (10.67%), comparing to 0.47% for members. The purchase frequency calculated by averaging the total orders is higher for non-members (1.14), comparing to 1.01 for members. This suggests that many customers may be joining the loyalty program solely to take advantage of some one-time offer like discounts, without remaining engaged with the company.

Based on the analysis, Technovaâ€™s loyalty program is failing to drive long-term customer engagement or increase revenue. Instead of encouraging repeat purchases, it appears to attract deal-seekers who exploit one-time benefits without fostering sustained customer loyalty.
