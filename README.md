## Executive Summary

## Deep Dive Insights
### Trend Analysis

### Geographic Distribution
TechNova’s total orders are primarily concentrated in English-speaking countries, with the U.S. leading, followed by Great Britain (GB), Australia (AU), and Canada (CA).

At a regional level:
- North America (NA) has the highest total orders, followed by EMEA, APAC, and LATAM.
- APAC has the highest average order value (AOV), surpassing North America, EMEA, and LATAM.

This indicates strong demand from English-speaking markets, but higher spending per order in APAC suggests potential for strategic growth in that region.

### Logistics 
Orders take an average of 7.51 days from purchase to delivery, with order processing taking 2.01 days and shipping taking 5.5 days. Regionally, APAC and EMEA have the longest total delivery times (7.59 days), while LATAM (7.44 days) and NA (7.48 days) are slightly faster. LATAM processes orders the fastest (1.93 days), while APAC is the slowest (2.12 days). Shipping times are similar across regions, with APAC being slightly faster (5.48 days) and EMEA/NA the slowest (5.51 days). Optimizing order processing and shipping efficiencies in APAC and EMEA could reduce overall delivery times.

### Refund Rate 
Orders above $150 (6.52%) are returned the most, while low-value orders ($0-$50) have the lowest refund rate (1.55%). Breaking down the refund rate by product, the highest return rates are from the two laptops ThinkPad (11.73%) and MacBook Air (11.43%), where North America sees the highest laptop refunds, followed by APAC and LATAM. North America has the highest refund rate, followed by APAC, EMEA, and LATAM. LATAM (4.15%) has the lowest refund rate, possibly due to fewer high-value purchases, while APAC (4.95%) and EMEA (4.73%) are closer to the average.

Unknown sources (11.76%) and social media (7.51%) have the highest refund rates, indicating poor targeting or impulse buying, while email (4.81%) and affiliate (5.00%) perform better, indicating more informed buying behavior.

Website (5.58%) has a higher refund rate than mobile app (2.05%), suggesting stronger purchase commitment via apps.

### Loyalty Program
Among the 32,501 loyalty members, the customer lifetime value (CLV), which evaluates how valuable a customer is over time , is significantly lower than non-members, averaging only $242.75, compared to $313.37 for non-members. This indicates that loyalty members do not contribute as much long-term value as expected.

Additionally, loyalty members have fewer total orders (32,789) and average order value ($240.62) compared to non-members (48,071; $274.66). Members also exhibit a refund rate of 6.39%, which is higher than non-members (4.16%).  For the refunded items, loyalty members have a average refund price of $297.38, a total of 2,095 refunds and with the highest refund price of $1,444.94, while the corresponding numbers for non-members are $549.79 average refund price, 2,000 refunds, and the highest refund price of $3,146.88. The concerns for refunds and buying high-price items don't seem to be the reason that incentivize customers to join loyalty program. 

The most concerning trend is that 99.53% of loyalty members make only a single purchase while the repeat purchase rate for non-members is 23x higher (10.67%), comparing to 0.47% for members. The purchase frequency calculated by averaging the total orders is higher for non-members (1.14), comparing to 1.01 for members. This suggests that many customers may be joining the loyalty program solely to take advantage of some one-time offer like discounts, without remaining engaged with the company.

Based on the analysis, TechNova’s loyalty program is failing to drive long-term customer engagement or increase revenue. Instead of encouraging repeat purchases, it appears to attract deal-seekers who exploit one-time benefits without fostering sustained customer loyalty.

### Marketing Channel
Among the 92,527 customers, only 4,902 are repeating customers while the average order value by returning customers ($422.34) is 1.7x higher than new customers ($250.16). 

The direct marketing channel is the most effective, generating the highest total sales ($17.48M) and the most orders (62,854) with a strong average order value (AOV) of $278.06. The null (unattributed) category follows with significant sales ($7.26M) and a comparable AOV ($256.94), suggesting a need to track its origin. Affiliate marketing has the highest AOV ($317.85), indicating high-value transactions despite lower order volume (2,102). Email marketing drives a decent number of orders (13,832) but has a relatively low AOV ($177.79), while social media contributes fewer orders (1,012) but maintains a moderate AOV ($234.64). Unknown sources have minimal impact. Improving attribution tracking and optimizing lower-performing channels could enhance overall effectiveness.

Social media performs well with a 68.92% conversion rate, suggesting strong engagement, though it takes the longest for users to make their first purchase (49.14 days). Affiliate marketing also has a high conversion rate (53.74%) but a slightly shorter time to first purchase (47.79 days). The null category has moderate performance (45.16% conversion rate) but slow conversion (52.32 days). Email marketing drives a large number of signups (13,356) but has a much lower 10.69% conversion rate, indicating potential drop-offs. Direct traffic, despite the highest number of signups (57,722), has the lowest conversion rate (2.53%), suggesting that while many users visit directly, few convert, or they take a different path to conversion.

## Recommendations

### Refund 
- Improve product descriptions and quality control for high-value products to lower return rates and investigate high laptop return rates, especially in NA and APAC, and adjust policies or support.
- Refine social media marketing to reduce impulse purchases and misinformation.
- Promote mobile app purchases, as they result in fewer refunds.

### Loyalty Program
Instead of rewarding new members with discounts, introduce tier-based loyalty program to enhance customer loyalty. 
- **Basic Members**: Get free shipping after 2 purchases.
- **Gold Members**: Earn cashback or discounts on their 3rd+ purchase.
- **Platinum Members**: Get exclusive early access to new products.
