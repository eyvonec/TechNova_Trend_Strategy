# TechNova Trend and Strategy Analysis
Founded in 2018, TechNova is a global e-commerce company specializing in electronics and tech products. Initially focused on online sales, Technova has expanded its reach through both its website and mobile app, catering to a diverse international customer base.

To acquire and retain customers, Technova leverages a mix of marketing channels, including email campaigns, social media, SEO, and affiliate partnerships. The company has built a strong reputation for offering premium and high-demand tech products, particularly from Apple, Samsung, and ThinkPad, among others.

## Executive Summary
[TechNova’s sales peak in Nov-Dec but decline post-holidays. APAC shows premium potential with the highest AOV, while logistics inefficiencies in APAC & EMEA need optimization. High-value products and social media-driven sales drive the most refunds, despite social meida has the highest conversion rate, implying potential impulsive purchasing. The loyalty program fails to drive retention, with 99.53% of members making only one purchase. As returning customers generate higher average order value, there is a need to change loyalty program policy to increase returning customers. In addition, marketing should focus on social media (higher conversion rate) and affiliate program, which generates highest average order value. ]

## Deep Dive Insights
### Overview
Between 2019 and 2022, the dataset records 108K orders and $28M in sales. TechNova serves customers from 193 countries and offers a portfolio of 8 electronic product categories, including laptops, monitors, and headphones. 

### Trend Analysis
In March 2020, a pronounced spike suggests a pandemic-driven surge in demand—particularly for items like monitors, headphones, and laptops—while a significant dip in October 2022 may reflect market shifts or economic pressures.

Seasonal trends are evident, with November and December consistently recording the highest growth (likely due to holiday shopping) followed by a downturn in the surrounding months.

Comparing total sales, order count, and average order value (AOV) reveals that sales and order counts generally correlate. However, AOV sometimes diverges, indicating periods when customers favor higher-value purchases.

Additionally, the data shows that 2019 and 2020 experienced more prominent growth spikes, whereas 2021 and 2022 saw more frequent declines. This shift could be attributed to factors such as post-pandemic market saturation, inflation, or the inherently less frequent nature of electronics purchases compared to essentials.

### Geographic Distribution
TechNova's total sales are primarily concentrated in English-speaking countries, with the U.S. leading, followed by Great Britain and Canada. Although the overall sales distribution remained consistent from 2019 to 2022, the pandemic year of 2020 saw an increase in total sales across the top 10 countries (especially US had total sales over $3M USD), reflecting a global surge in demand for electronic devices.

![Sheet 3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/845291a5-d4ff-4559-bd1d-051c280ab859)

Regionally, North America records the highest total orders, followed by EMEA, APAC, and LATAM, while EMEA boasts the highest average order value (AOV), outpacing APAC, North America, and LATAM. Given that most customers currently come from North America, TechNova should consider expanding further into the EMEA market to capture high-value clientele.

### Logistics 
On average, orders take 7.51 days from purchase to delivery—2.01 days for processing and 5.5 days for shipping. Regional variations are minimal, especially in the shipment-to-delivery phase. Notably, in 2019, APAC and EMEA experienced slightly longer order-to-shipment times compared to LATAM and North America; however, from 2020 onward, logistic efficiency has normalized across all four regions.

### Refund Rate 
Between 2019 and 2021, laptops experienced a notably higher refund rate—likely due to their nature and price point. Interestingly, 2021 saw a significant drop in refunds compared to the previous two years. For instance, for MacBooks and ThinkPad Laptops, the refund rate in 2019 and 2020 were over 16% while in 2021 the refund rate for all products dropped to less than 10%. However, no refund data is available for 2022, leaving room for two interpretations: either improvements in product information and logistics have minimized customer regret, or the refund data for 2022 is simply missing.

Additionally, it’s worth noting that Bose Headphones recorded zero refunds across all four years. This exceptional performance invites further investigation into the factors driving such positive results.

### Loyalty Program
Among the 32,501 loyalty members, the average customer lifetime value (CLV) is only $242.75—significantly lower than the $313.37 observed for non-members. This disparity suggests that loyalty members are not delivering the long-term value expected.

Key observations include:

- **Order Volume & Value:**  
  - Loyalty members placed 32,789 total orders with an average order value of $240.62, compared to 48,071 orders and an average order value of $274.66 for non-members.

- **Refund Rates:**  
  - Members exhibit a refund rate of 6.39%, notably higher than the 4.16% for non-members.  
  - This trend persists across 2019 to 2021—with 2020 being particularly striking, as members had a 13% refund rate versus 7% for non-members—suggesting a correlation between membership and increased refunds.

- **Product-Specific Trends:**  
  - A majority of customers purchasing headphones and webcams (over 55%) join the loyalty program.  
  - In 2022, every customer who bought Bose Headphones became a loyalty member.

- **Repeat Purchase Behavior:**  
  - A staggering 99.53% of loyalty members made only a single purchase, while non-members exhibited a 10.67% repeat purchase rate.  
  - The average purchase frequency is 1.01 for members compared to 1.14 for non-members.

These findings indicate that many customers may be joining the loyalty program solely to access one-time offers like discounts, without engaging in repeat purchases or long-term relationships with TechNova.

In summary, the current loyalty program appears to be failing in its goal of driving sustained customer engagement and revenue growth, instead attracting deal-seekers who do not contribute significant long-term value.

### Marketing Channel
Among 92,527 customers, only 4,902 are repeat buyers, yet returning customers boast an average order value (AOV) of $422—approximately 1.7 times higher than the $250 recorded for new customers.

**Marketing Channel Performance:**

- **Direct Marketing:**  
  Generates the highest total sales of $17.48M and 62,854 orders, with a strong AOV of $278.

- **Unattributed (Null) Category:**  
  Accounts for significant sales of $7.26M and an AOV of $256, highlighting a need for better tracking of its origins.

- **Affiliate Marketing:**  
  Despite a lower order volume of 2,102, it achieves the highest AOV at $317, indicating high-value transactions.

- **Email Marketing:**  
  Drives a healthy number of orders (13,832) but with a relatively low AOV of $177.

- **Social Media:**  
  Contributes fewer orders (1,012) while maintaining a moderate AOV of $234.

Unknown sources have minimal impact. Improving attribution tracking and optimizing lower-performing channels could enhance overall effectiveness.

**Conversion Rate Insights:**

- Conversion rates across channels have remained relatively stable over the years (over 99%).
- The affiliate program stands out with a 100% conversion rate, outperforming social media, direct marketing, and email.
- In 2020, all channels experienced a dip in performance—likely due to pandemic-related disruptions in marketing activities.

## Recommendations

### Refund 
- Improve product descriptions and quality control for high-value products to lower return rates and investigate high laptop return rates, especially in NA and APAC, and adjust policies or support.
- Refine social media marketing to reduce impulse purchases and misinformation.
- Promote mobile app purchases, as they result in fewer refunds.

### Loyalty Program
Instead of rewarding new members with discounts, introduce tier-based loyalty program to enhance customer loyalty. 
- **Basic Members**: Get free shipping after 2 purchases.
- **Gold Members**: Earn cashback or discounts on their 3rd+ purchase.
- **Platinum Members**: Get exclusive early access to new products.
